# BreweryCLI

Welcome to my Brewery CLI! Running the CLI will bring up a list of the top 50 breweries in the United States. To get more information on a brewery, input the rank number next to the brewery. "Back" will take you back to the list of breweries and "exit" will exit the program.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Brewery_Search'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Brewery_Search

## Usage

TODO: Enter the rank number next to the brewery of interest. Once the number of the interested brewery is entered, more details will show. Type "back" to go back to the brewery list and "exit" to exit.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
